higher-frequency data (that is, data that are published with less of a lag than the ONS release and can give us some information about economic performance in February and March), to form a forecast for the remaining months in the quarter we are currently in (February and March).\\\\n Using quarter-on-quarter GDP growth, which is the average GDP growth in the three months making up a quarter, in reference to the average of the previous quarter, can help to establish a more stable pattern for economic performance.\\\\n To produce a forecast of the first quarter of 2023, we combine the latest ONS data with higher-frequency data (such as survey indicators of consumer confidence, which give us information about spending in services like retail, or weather data that can inform our estimates of construction output) in our NIESR ‘Tracker’ analysis.\\\\n The main sectors that make up the UK economy are: services (healthcare, restaurants, consulting, transport, etc.), which make up around 80% of GDP; production (manufacturing, mining, etc.), which makes up around 14% of GDP; construction (residential and commercial building work, etc.), which makes up around 6% of GDP; and agriculture (farming), which makes up less than 1% of GDP.\\\\n The latest data, together with a forecast produced by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), give a cautiously optimistic
